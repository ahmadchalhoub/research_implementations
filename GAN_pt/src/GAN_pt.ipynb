    "### This is the implementation of a very simple GAN (Generative Adversarial Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is first trial at implementing an algorithm from a research paper; in this case, 'Generative Adversarial Nets' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, I am using many resources and basically just dipping my toes in the world of applied ML, as I hope to to gain two main outcomes of this. First, I would like to improve my actual coding skills when it comes to implementing ML/DL algorithms, as I would like to eventually be able to actually read complex publications and implement them myself. This will also help me stay updated with the new advancements happening in this field. Second, it will hopefully keep me in touch with the actual technical part and prevent me from simply being an 'implementer of github projects'. \n",
    "\n",
    "PS: the actual code for this implementation is a combination of the code shown in both the following Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-deep-learning-research-papers-to-code-f-f38bbd87352f as well as the following YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OljTVUVzPpM. I just made very small changes and added more detailed comments for more clarity.\n"
