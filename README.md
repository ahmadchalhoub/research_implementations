# research_implementations
The goal behind this repo is to try to keep both my coding skills as well as my technical machine learning knowledge up-to-date with the advancements happening in this field to the best of my abilities. 

I found myself enjoying both coding as well as reading research papers and understanding what actually makes up models and makes them work (all of the detailed math; yes, I am a nerd I know. So I figured the best way to achieve this would be to choose publications that interest me, read and understand them, and work on implementing them in code.

I am always open for feedback and am not scared of making mistakes, so please feel free to reach out with any comments that you might have.
