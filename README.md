# research_implementations
The goal behind this repo is to try to keep both my coding skills as well as my technical machine learning knowledge up-to-date with the advancements happening in this field to the best of my abilities. 

I found myself enjoying both coding as well as reading research papers and understanding what actually makes up models and makes them work (all of the detailed math; yes, I am a nerd I know. So I figured the best way to achieve this would be to choose publications that interest me, read and understand them, and work on implementing them in code.

One thing I would also like to do is to document this progress through YouTube videos for me to both watch myself improve over time as well as help others learn and grow, so I am hoping to begin that process soon.

I am always open for feedback and am not scared of making mistakes, so please feel free to reach out with any comments that you might have.
